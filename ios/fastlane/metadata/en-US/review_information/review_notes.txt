InnerCycles is a personal journaling app for mood tracking, self-reflection, and emotional pattern recognition. No login is required — users can start journaling immediately.

HOW TO TEST:
1. Launch the app and complete the brief onboarding (enter name, select focus areas).
2. On the home screen, create a journal entry. After saving, a first-entry celebration appears.
3. Explore Dream Journal, Mood Tracking, and Pattern insights from the home feed.
4. Open Settings to see profile, notification preferences, and Premium subscription options.
5. Check iOS Widgets: add InnerCycles widgets from the Home Screen editor.

SIGN-IN: Optional. Users may sign in with Apple for cloud backup. All core features work without an account.

SUBSCRIPTIONS: InnerCycles Premium is offered as Monthly ($7.99) and Annual ($29.99) auto-renewing subscriptions, plus a Lifetime ($79.99) one-time purchase, via RevenueCat/StoreKit 2. Free users have full access to journaling, dream logging, and basic pattern insights; Premium unlocks AI reflections, advanced patterns, and an ad-free experience.

ATT PROMPT: The app requests App Tracking Transparency permission to serve personalized ads via Google AdMob. If the user declines, only non-personalized ads are shown. Premium subscribers see no ads.

CONTENT: Reflective prompts and insights are generated from a curated content database combined with AI-assisted content generation. AI-generated content is clearly labeled, safety-filtered to remove predictive or diagnostic language. No user-generated content is displayed to other users. The app does not provide medical, psychological, or predictive advice. Full AI usage policy at https://umutnull-woltemade.github.io/innercycles/ai-policy.html.

APPLE WATCH: Companion app for quick mood logging. Data synced via WatchConnectivity.
