Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback regarding our app Venus One (formerly rejected under Guideline 4.3(b) - Spam).

We understand and respect Apple's concern about saturation in the astrology and horoscope category. We have made significant changes to address this feedback.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT WE REMOVED
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Daily/weekly/monthly horoscope features (hidden in this build)
• Zodiac sign selection and identity reveal during onboarding
• Future prediction claims throughout the app
• Fortune-telling language ("what awaits you", "destiny", "fate")
• Predictive tarot spreads ("Past-Present-Future")

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT WE CHANGED
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Repositioned as a personal reflection and journaling app
• All AI responses are now present-focused questions, not predictions
• Symbolic content is framed as cultural reference for creative reflection
• User must actively input thoughts before receiving any response
• Added visible entertainment disclaimer on primary screens
• Renamed "Destiny Number" to "Expression Number"
• Replaced all "awaits you" phrases with neutral alternatives

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT THE APP NOW DOES
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Presents daily reflection prompts
2. Allows users to journal their thoughts
3. Tracks patterns in user entries over time
4. Provides follow-up questions for deeper self-reflection
5. Offers symbol exploration as creative prompts (not readings)

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

We implemented a feature flag system that hides all high-risk features:
- Horoscope screens → Redirected to Insight (reflection) screen
- Predictive features → Blocked at router level
- Zodiac identity → Removed from onboarding flow
- Fortune-telling routes → Return 404 or redirect

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The app no longer provides horoscopes, predictions, or any claims about the future. It functions as an interactive journaling companion with reflection prompts.

We have also updated our App Store description, keywords, and screenshots to accurately reflect this new focus.

We believe these changes differentiate Venus One from typical astrology apps and position it as a self-care and mindfulness tool.

We are committed to compliance and happy to make any additional changes you recommend.

Thank you for reconsidering our submission.

Best regards,
Venus One Development Team
