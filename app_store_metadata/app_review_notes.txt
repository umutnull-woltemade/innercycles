CONTENT APPROACH
======================================================================

All content in the app is:
- Based on user's own entries and self-reported data
- Reflective in nature ("past entries suggest...", "you may notice...")
- Never predictive ("will happen", "your future", "destiny")
- For self-awareness and personal growth purposes

The app uses personality archetypes (e.g., The Pioneer, The Builder)
as a framework for reflection prompts. These are framed as personality
profiles, not predictions or deterministic claims.
