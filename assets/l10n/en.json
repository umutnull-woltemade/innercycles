            "dream_falling": "Falling dreams are among the most common experiences people report. Many find these dreams surface during times when they're navigating uncertainty or feeling like aspects of life are beyond their control.\n\nI'm curious whether this dream has been recurring - the pattern itself might be worth exploring. What's been happening in your waking life lately? Sometimes our minds process daytime concerns through nighttime imagery.\n\nWhat does falling feel like in the dream - is it frightening, freeing, or something else entirely?",
            "dream_water": "Water dreams are something many people experience. Water can represent different things for different people - sometimes emotions, sometimes change, sometimes cleansing.\n\nWhat was the water like in your dream? Was it calm, turbulent, deep, shallow? The specific qualities might connect to what's happening in your waking life.\n\nHow did you feel during the dream?",
            "dream_flying": "Flying dreams are among the most memorable dream experiences. Many people associate them with feelings of freedom, gaining perspective, or escaping limitations.\n\nWas the flight effortless or were you struggling? Were you flying high or staying close to the ground? These details might hold personal meaning for you.\n\nHow did you feel while flying - exhilarated, scared, in control?",
            "dream_chase": "Being chased in dreams is something many people experience. It often surfaces when we're feeling pressured or avoiding something in waking life.\n\nDo you remember what was chasing you? And were you able to escape or were you caught? These details might be worth exploring for what they mean to you.\n\nIs there anything that's been \"chasing\" you in your mind lately - something you've been avoiding?",
            "dream_teeth": "Teeth dreams are among the most commonly reported dream themes. Different people experience them differently - some see teeth falling out, some breaking, some loose.\n\nMany people associate these dreams with concerns about self-image, communication, or some kind of transition in their lives.\n\nWhat exactly happened in the dream, and how did it make you feel?",
            "dream_general_1": "Thank you for sharing your dream. Dreams can be a way our mind processes thoughts and feelings that our waking mind doesn't always get to address.\n\nWhat was the dominant feeling during the dream? And do you sense any connection to what's been happening in your life recently?\n\nWhat part of the dream stayed with you most?",
            "dream_general_2": "That's an interesting dream experience. Dreams are often our subconscious mind's way of processing our thoughts and experiences.\n\nWhat was the most vivid part of the dream? And how did you feel when you woke up - relieved, unsettled, curious?\n\nHas anything happened recently that might have triggered this dream?",
            "pattern_1": "Noticing a pattern is a powerful sign of self-awareness. Many people live inside cycles without ever recognizing them.\n\nDo you remember when this pattern first started? And what feelings or situations typically accompany this pattern?\n\nHow do you feel when you notice yourself in this pattern?",
            "pattern_2": "Patterns often try to tell us something - recurring behaviors or situations usually connect to a deeper need or belief.\n\nWhat does this pattern give you? Sometimes the things we repeat serve us in some way, even if it's hard to recognize.\n\nIf you wanted to break this cycle, what would your first step be?",
            "emotion_anxiety": "Anxiety can be a challenging feeling to sit with. It's often our body's way of saying something needs our attention - even if it's not always accurate.\n\nWhere do you feel the anxiety most - in your body, your thoughts, or both? And what typically triggers it?\n\nIs there anything that's been helping you cope with this anxiety right now?",
            "emotion_sadness": "Sadness is a natural emotion that helps us process our experiences. Sometimes it signals that something matters to us.\n\nWhen did this sadness start? And do you know what it's connected to - a specific event, or is it more of a general feeling?\n\nHow are you taking care of yourself right now?",
            "emotion_anger": "Anger often signals that our boundaries have been crossed or that we sense something isn't fair. It's an important emotion to pay attention to.\n\nWhat do you think is at the root of this anger? And how do you typically express this feeling - do you hold it in or let it out?\n\nCould there be other feelings underneath this anger?",
            "emotion_overwhelmed": "Feeling overwhelmed is a signal that we're facing demands that exceed our current capacity. This feeling is valid and something many people experience.\n\nCan you identify what feels most overwhelming right now? Sometimes naming just one thing can make things feel more manageable.\n\nHave you had a chance to take a breath?",
            "emotion_general": "Being in touch with your emotions is an important self-awareness skill. Whatever you're feeling is valid.\n\nHow long has this feeling been present? And where do you feel it in your body?\n\nWhat do you need most right now?",
            "decision_1": "Decision-making can be challenging, especially when there are multiple valid options. Being able to see both sides is actually a sign of thoughtful consideration.\n\nIf you imagined the best outcome of each choice, which one excites you more? And what would be the worst outcome of each?\n\nWhat does your gut tell you?",
            "decision_2": "Decisions often require us to balance multiple values at once. Could there be conflicting values that make this decision feel difficult?\n\nLooking back a year from now, which choice would you want to have made?\n\nWhat's preventing you from seeing this decision more clearly?",
            "relationship_1": "Relationships can be some of the most meaningful yet challenging aspects of our lives. Each relationship has its own dynamics.\n\nWhat are you feeling most in this relationship right now? And do you know what you're hoping for from this relationship?\n\nIn an ideal scenario, what would this relationship look like?",
            "relationship_2": "Challenges in relationships often reveal something about our needs or boundaries.\n\nWhat matters most to you in this situation? And have you been able to express that to the other person?\n\nHow do you feel about yourself in this relationship?",
            "self_discovery_1": "The journey of self-discovery is a lifelong process. Asking questions shows you're already on this path.\n\nWhen do you feel most like yourself in life? And when do you struggle to feel like yourself?\n\nHow would someone who knows you best describe you?",
            "self_discovery_2": "Discovering who we are takes courage. Every experience teaches us something about ourselves.\n\nHave you ever thought about what your values - what you truly care about - are?\n\nWhat would you change in your life right now?",
            "general_1": "Thank you for sharing what's on your mind. Sometimes just putting thoughts into words can help us see them more clearly.\n\nWhat's been weighing on you the most? And how long has this been on your mind?\n\nWhat outcome would you hope for?",
            "general_2": "It sounds like you have a lot going on. Taking time to reflect is a valuable practice.\n\nIf you could change one thing about this situation, what would it be?\n\nWhat support do you need right now?"
