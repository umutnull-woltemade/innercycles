# Safe Monetization Framework

## Principles

1. **No locked core features** — Journal, basic patterns, and daily insights are always free
2. **No urgency manipulation** — No countdown timers, no "limited offers"
3. **No dark patterns** — No confusing cancellation flows, no hidden charges
4. **No outcome promises** — Subscription is "extended access", never "guaranteed results"
5. **Value extension model** — Premium adds depth and breadth, not gates

## Conversion Touchpoints (Non-Aggressive)

### Touchpoint 1: After 7th Journal Entry
- Context: Patterns screen unlocks, user sees first insights
- Message: "Your patterns are emerging. Explore deeper with the full insight library."
- CTA: "See what's included" (not "Buy now")

### Touchpoint 2: Weekly Reflection Summary
- Context: End of week summary shows limited insight
- Message: "Want to see how your focus areas connect? Premium reveals correlations."
- CTA: "Learn more"

### Touchpoint 3: Archetype Discovery
- Context: User explores free archetypes, taps locked one
- Message: "This archetype explores [theme]. Unlock all 17 profiles."
- CTA: "Preview content"

### Touchpoint 4: 30-Day Milestone
- Context: User has been active for 30 days
- Message: "You've built a meaningful journal. Guided exercises can deepen your practice."
- CTA: "Explore exercises"

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)
- Pop-up on app launch
- Blocking content mid-read
- Countdown timers
- "X users upgraded today" social proof pressure
- "Don't miss out" language
- Repeated prompts after dismissal (respect "Not now" for 7 days)
