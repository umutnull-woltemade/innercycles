## THE VENUS ONE VOICE

### Core Characteristics

| Trait | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Warm** | Friendly and supportive, like a thoughtful friend | "You might find it meaningful to consider..." |
| **Inviting** | Opens doors without pushing | "This theme invites reflection on..." |

### What We Sound Like

**Good Example:**
> "The fire archetype, associated with signs like Aries in Western astrology, often symbolizes initiative, courage, and the drive to begin new things. This week might be a meaningful time to reflect on where you feel called to take action in your life.
>
> *Journaling prompt: What would I pursue if I fully trusted my instincts?*"

**Bad Example (OLD STYLE - AVOID):**
> "Mars energy is at full power today! Your natural leadership is shining. It's the perfect day for action - move before you think! Opportunities are raining down on you!"
