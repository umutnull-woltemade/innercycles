## Review Notes for Apple

```
Dear App Review Team,

InnerCycles is a personal reflection and journaling application. Key points for review:

1. CONTENT NATURE: All content is educational and reflective. The app does not provide
   predictions, forecasts, or deterministic claims about users' futures. Archetype content
   is based on classical symbolism and psychology, presented as educational material.

2. JOURNALING SYSTEM: The core feature is a structured journaling system where users
   track five life dimensions (Energy, Focus, Emotions, Decisions, Social). Pattern
   analysis is based solely on the user's own recorded data, not external predictions.

3. NO ASTROLOGY PREDICTIONS: This app does not provide horoscopes, zodiac forecasts,
   or astrological predictions. While it references archetypal symbolism for educational
   purposes, no predictive claims are made.

4. SUBSCRIPTION: Premium features extend the reflection experience with additional
   content (more archetypes, exercises, prompts). Core journaling functionality is
   fully free. No content is locked behind a paywall that would impair basic functionality.

5. PRIVACY: All journal data is stored locally on the user's device using SharedPreferences.
   No personal reflection data is transmitted to any server.

6. AI DISCLOSURE: The app does not use real-time AI features. All content is pre-written
   and bundled with the app. No API calls are made to AI services during normal app usage.

Test account: Not required (no server-side authentication needed for core features).
Sign in with Apple is available but optional.

Thank you for your review.

## AI Usage Disclosure (Apple Requirement)

"InnerCycles does not use real-time artificial intelligence, machine learning models, or generative AI during normal app operation. All reflection content, archetype descriptions, and journaling prompts are pre-written by human authors and bundled within the app. The Pattern Engine analyzes your locally-stored journal data using deterministic algorithms (averages, trends, correlations) — no AI or ML models are involved in this analysis. No user data is sent to AI services."
