## REVIEWER FAQ

**Q: Is this a horoscope/astrology app?**
A: InnerCycles uses archetypal themes (some of which originate from astrological traditions) as a framework for journaling and reflection. Unlike traditional horoscope apps, we do not make predictions about future events. Our content is framed as cultural education and self-reflection prompts.

**Q: Does the app tell users what will happen to them?**
A: No. All content uses reflective language ("you might consider," "some find it helpful to") rather than predictive language ("you will," "this will happen"). We explicitly disclaim any predictive function.

**Q: Are compatibility percentages or predictions provided?**
A: No. Our relationship content focuses on self-reflection about relationship patterns, not compatibility predictions. We've removed all numerical compatibility claims.

**Q: What about tarot or card readings?**
A: Our card features are symbol-based journaling prompts, not fortune-telling. Each card is presented as an archetypal theme for reflection, with explicit disclaimers that cards do not predict outcomes.

**Q: Does the app recommend "lucky" numbers or days?**
A: No. We've removed all "lucky/unlucky" language. Cultural associations (like "Tuesday is traditionally associated with Mars") are presented as educational information only.

**Q: How is this different from fortune-telling apps?**
A:
1. We never use future-tense predictions
2. All content has reflection/journaling focus
3. Explicit disclaimers on every content piece
4. No claims of accuracy or supernatural knowledge
5. Positioned as lifestyle/wellness, not supernatural
