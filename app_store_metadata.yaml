# ── DESCRIPTION (iOS — not indexed, optimized for conversion) ────────────
description: |
  Map the emotional cycles you repeat without realizing it.

  InnerCycles is a cyclical intelligence system — not a mood diary. It detects recurring emotional patterns across your journal entries, dreams, and check-ins. Over time, it shows you where you are in your emotional rhythms — and what you wrote last time you felt this way.

  HOW IT WORKS:

  Every journal entry, dream, and emotional check-in feeds a pattern recurrence engine. The system identifies when you re-enter familiar emotional territory and surfaces past entries from similar cycle positions.

  - Cycle-Mapped Journaling — Each entry is plotted on your emotional timeline with recurrence detection
  - Dream Archaeology — Record dreams and track recurring symbols, story arcs, shadow integration, and archetype patterns across your dream history
  - Recurrence Detection Engine — Identifies when emotional patterns repeat across weeks and months
  - Archetype Progression — Tracks how your dominant personality archetype evolves based on what you write, dream, and explore
  - Shadow-Light Integration — Tracks your relationship with difficult emotions through journaling milestones
  - Wellness Rhythm Tracking — Observe energy patterns across physical, emotional, and intellectual dimensions over time
  - Cycle Position Reports — Weekly and monthly reports showing where you are in recurring patterns
  - Private & Secure — Your data is encrypted, with optional cloud sync under your control

  WHO IT'S FOR:

  People who notice they repeat the same emotional patterns but cannot see why. People who want structure around their inner life — not motivational quotes, but a system that maps what recurs and when.

# ── REVIEW NOTES (paste into App Store Connect → App Review Information) ──
review_notes: |
  InnerCycles is a cyclical pattern intelligence app built around journaling. No login is required — users can start journaling immediately.

  HOW TO TEST:
  1. Launch the app and complete the brief onboarding (enter name, optional birth date).
  2. On the home screen, create a journal entry to begin feeding the cycle engine.
  3. Explore Dream Archaeology, Cycle-Mapped Journaling, and Pattern Reports from the home cards.
  4. Open Settings to see profile, notification preferences, and Premium subscription options.

  SIGN-IN: Optional. Users may sign in with Apple for cloud backup. All core features work without an account.

  SUBSCRIPTIONS: InnerCycles Premium is offered as Monthly and Annual auto-renewing subscriptions via RevenueCat/StoreKit 2. Free users have full access to journaling, dream logging, and basic cycle awareness; Premium unlocks full recurrence detection, unlimited dream archaeology, and an ad-free experience.

  ATT PROMPT: The app requests App Tracking Transparency permission to serve personalized ads via Google AdMob. If the user declines, only non-personalized ads are shown. Premium subscribers see no ads.

  CONTENT: Reflective prompts, dream symbol definitions, and cycle analysis text are generated locally from a curated content database combined with AI-assisted content generation. AI-generated content is clearly labeled, safety-filtered to remove predictive or diagnostic language, and reviewed by human editors. No user-generated content is displayed to other users. The app does not provide medical, psychological, or predictive advice. Full AI usage policy at https://innercycles.app/ai-policy.

  ARCHETYPE SYSTEM: The app uses a personality archetype framework (Pioneer, Builder, Communicator, etc.) inspired by narrative psychology and personality typing systems like the Enneagram and MBTI. These are NOT zodiac signs. The initial archetype is assigned via an onboarding quiz based on self-reported preferences. The system tracks how a user's dominant archetype evolves over time based on what they write and explore.

  BIRTH DATE: Birth date is collected solely for age verification and birthday-themed reflection prompts (e.g., "birthday reflection" on the user's birthday). Birth time and city fields exist for timezone-aware notification scheduling and are fully optional. No astrological calculations are performed.

  PRIVACY: No personal data is shared with third parties beyond analytics (Apple App Analytics) and ads (AdMob). Full privacy policy at https://innercycles.app/privacy.
